# git:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "added notes"
git push origin main

### more git

to view commit history in github, click on the clock icon "commits"

git remote set-url origin < url >

### I switched to 'detached HEAD' state.

`git checkout 7d<***   commit   hash   ***   k>6`
M .gitignore
Note: switching to '7d<***   commit   hash   ***   k>6'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

`git switch -c <new-branch-name>`

### where am I? _git_

If you are on branch main (see this with:  ``` git branch```) and you want to know the
hash of main, type: ```git log -n 1 main```

### type: ```git show main```    for the following info:

# salt

In blockchain smart contracts, "salt" typically refers to a random value that is used to enhance the security of certain cryptographic operations, especially in the context of creating unique hash values. One common use of salt is in the process of hashing passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks.

A rainbow table attack is a type of precomputed attack on password hashes. It's a method used by attackers to crack hashed passwords more efficiently than traditional brute-force attacks. The concept involves creating a large table (the "rainbow table") that contains precomputed hash values for a vast number of possible plaintext inputs, such as passwords. The idea is to look up the hash of the target password in the table to find the corresponding plaintext password.

Here's a simplified overview of how `rainbow table attacks` work:

Hashing and Reduction Functions: The attacker starts by creating a table of precomputed hash values. This table is generated by applying a cryptographic hash function repeatedly, often using a series of reduction functions to create new inputs for subsequent hash operations.

Chain Generation: The attacker creates chains of hashed values by repeatedly applying the hash and reduction functions. Each chain starts with a randomly chosen plaintext value.

Table Storage: The endpoint of each chain (the final hash in the sequence) is stored in the rainbow table, along with the starting plaintext value.

Attack: When the attacker obtains a hashed password (e.g., from a compromised database), they can look up the hash in the rainbow table. If a match is found, the corresponding plaintext from the chain is the password.

# Proof of Code

### reading from storage to show that private variables are not private

1. Run Anvil chain
2. Use the contract addres:
   run: `cast storage 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`

output:
| Name | Type | Slot | Offset | Bytes | Value | Hex Value | Contract |
|------------|---------|------|--------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| s_owner | address | 0 | 0 | 20 | 1390849295786071768276380950238675083608645509734 | 0x000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 | src/PasswordStore.sol:PasswordStore |
| s_password | string | 1 | 0 | 32 | 49516443757395204518384437876896412918898210405993719258753982441762571943956 | 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014 | src/PasswordStore.sol:PasswordStore |

### _or run:_

cast storage 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
to target storage slot 1 specifically. This gives output:
0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
This is the hex representation of the stored password.

To decode this, run in CLI:
`cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

output: _myPassword_

# findings report:

chatGpt 3.5 prompt\*\*\*:

The following is a markdown write up of a finding in a smart contract codebase,
can you help me make sureit is grammatically correct, and formatted nicely?

\*\*\* does not work most of the time...

### Make the findings report into a PDF

https://github.com/Cyfrin/audit-report-templating

1. Add all your findings to a markdown file like report-example.md
   i. Add the metadata you see at the top of that file
2. Install pandoc & LaTeX
3. Download eisvogel.latex and add to your templates directory (should be ~/.pandoc/templates/)
4. Add your logo to the directory as a pdf named logo.pdf
5. Run this command:
   `pandoc report.md -o report.pdf --from markdown --template=eisvogel --listings`

## FAQ:

Certain characters like â † do not work with pandoc, and you'll need to remove them to generate your final report.


# copy the report to your downloads folder in windows

with CLI command:  ```cp report.pdf /mnt/c/Users/pc/Downloads/```

make sure you're in the correct directory in VScode and type the exact file to copy...




# Working in HardHat

add ```require('solidity-coverage');```  to hardhat.config.js
run ```npx hardhat coverage```


# DoS 
Look for "for loops" where the "thing" that is iterated over, is not "bounded"
It it is not bounded to a particular size, can a user just add an arbitrarily 
amount of items to that list.
How much does it cost the user to do that?
If a user can do that and add a nearly infinite amount of things to that list
very cheaply, then you might have a critical or high vulnerability

Look for external calls (a call from the protocol to an external contact (wallet contract))
and see how this cal may fail. If you'd have a liquidate function that sends a remainder
of funds to the liquidated user, but the user ha set his contract/wallet up to NOT
receive crypto, the liquidate function will revert, preventing the liquidation.

### External function calls may fail if:

#1 Sending ether to a contract that does not accept it
#2 Calling a function that does not exist
#3 The external call execution runs out of gas
#4 Third-party contract is simply malicious

# Certora notes:

in the `.spec` file when writing a function in a rule: 
```vote(e, f, s, t); //considering only non reverting cases```
```vote@withrevert(e, f, s, t); //considering all cases```
